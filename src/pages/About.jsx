          Hi, I'm Tom üëãüèª ‚Äî a full stack engineer, lifelong gamer, and PC
          enthusiast. I've been into tech for as long as I can remember. Some of
          my favorite memories growing up are staying up late grinding in
          MapleStory, strategizing in Starcraft, or getting completely tilted in
          League of Legends (still happens, honestly). But beyond just playing,
          I was always curious about how these games worked. That curiosity
          eventually turned into a passion for building and upgrading my own PCs
          ‚Äî swapping out parts, troubleshooting hardware, and figuring out how
          everything fit together.
        </p>

          That hands-on experience with tech gave me a natural entry point into
          software engineering. I loved the idea of not just using technology,
          but actually creating with it ‚Äî building things that people could
          interact with, that could grow and evolve. These days, I work mostly
          with JavaScript and Python, focusing on scalable, flexible
          applications with clean, inclusive design.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the heart of it, I'm still that kid who loves to tinker and explore
          ‚Äî just with better tools now. Always happy to connect, whether it's
          about tech, gaming, or a new opportunity. You can reach me through
          email or the contact form below!
